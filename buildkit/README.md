# buildkit

**Status**: Dropped // I didn't need to implement a buildkit frontend anymore

Indeed, the [moby/buildkit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit) itself.

## Topics to explore

- [x] explore/experiment w/ builkt `llb`
- [ ] create a custom buildkit frontend
- [ ] _try_ to create a custom buildkit frontend in other language than Go
- [ ] _try_ to "compile" either frontend to wasm
- [ ] _try_ publishing an OCI image from wasm artifact (Might be a little off the scope)
- [ ] ???
- [ ] Profit!
